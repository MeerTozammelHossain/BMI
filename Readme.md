## Project Title  
BodyMetrics: Exploring Lifestyle, Location & Nutrition Impact on BMI

---

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes health and lifestyle data to understand the factors influencing Body Mass Index (BMI). Using SPSS, various statistical methods were applied to explore how demographic variables, food habits, diet types, living location, and working status relate to BMI and overall body composition.

---

## Objectives  
- Calculate BMI using height and weight data.  
- Describe the demographic and lifestyle profile of the study population.  
- Examine differences in BMI across gender, diet type, food habits, living location, and working status.  
- Explore associations among continuous variables like age, height, weight, and BMI.  
- Identify meaningful clusters within the population based on BMI, age, and lifestyle factors.  
- Build a regression model to predict BMI from demographic and lifestyle variables.  
- Visualize data distributions and relationships through graphs and charts.

## Data and Variables  
The dataset contains the following key variables:  
- `height_cm`, `weight_kg`, `height_m`, `bmi` (calculated)  
- `age_new`  
- `gender2`  
- `food_habit`, `diet_type`  
- `living_location`  
- `working_status`

## Methods and Analyses Performed  

### 1. BMI Calculation  
- Computed BMI using the formula:  
BMI = weight_kg / (height_m)^2

### 2. Descriptive Statistics  
- Calculated frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.  
- Computed means and standard deviations for continuous variables like age, height, weight, and BMI.

### 3. Graphical Visualizations  
- Created bar charts, boxplots, and scatterplots to visualize distributions and group differences.  

### 4. Cross-tabulation and Chi-Square Tests  
- Examined relationships between categorical variables (e.g., gender and diet type) using cross-tabulations and chi-square tests for independence.

### 5. Correlation Analysis  
- Assessed Pearson correlations among continuous variables (`age_new`, `bmi`, `height_cm`, `weight_kg`) to identify linear relationships.

### 6. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)  
- Tested differences in mean BMI across groups defined by categorical variables (`diet_type`, `working_status`, etc.).

### 7. K-Means Clustering  
- Segmented the population into 4 clusters based on BMI, age, height, weight, diet type, and working status.  
- Examined cluster centers and sizes to profile distinct groups within the dataset.

### 8. Regression Analysis  
- Built a linear regression model with BMI as the dependent variable and demographic & lifestyle factors as predictors.  
- Assessed which variables significantly influence BMI.
